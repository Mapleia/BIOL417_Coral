# A Phylogeny-Informed Analysis of the Global Coral-Symbiodiniaceae Interaction Network Reveals that Traits Correlated with Thermal Bleaching Are Specific to Symbiont Transmission Mode

{cite:t}`Swain_2021`

## Notes pulled from paper

> "Both bleaching susceptibility and thermotolerance indices assigned to coral and Symbiodiniaceae nodes exhibited high variability among species (17, 18) and were not significantly different among ocean basins, symbiont transmission modes, or life history strategies."

> "While certain patterns of associations were found to increase holobiont thermal resilience, they were not generalizable across the entire network and were instead constrained by symbiont transmission mode"

> "For example, Acropora millepora (horizontally transmitting) and Stylophora pistillata (vertically transmitting) experimentally exposed to temperature anomalies showed similar stress responses regarding breakdown of symbiont photosynthetic efficiency and symbiont loss, but differ significantly in the regulation and production of oxidative stress compounds"

> "Coral-Symbiodiniaceae interactions are known to change [...] However, these interactions are known for only a fraction of the species and seem to depend on the severity of stress [...] our analysis should be interpreted within the limitations of the ITS2 Symbiodiniaceae marker, which, due to high intragenomic variability (IGV), has shown poor resolution to distinguish multiple host-specific Symbiodiniaceae lineages recently identified by higher-resolution genetic markers [...] Nevertheless, the ITS2 marker is the most widely used and has the most extensively characterized thermotolerance of any available data"
