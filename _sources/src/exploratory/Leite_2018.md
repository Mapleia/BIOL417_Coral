# Specific plasmid patterns and high rates of bacterial co-occurrence within the coral holobiont

{cite:t}`Leite_2018`

## Notes pulled from paper
microbial‐community studies have shown that evaluation of co‐occurrence patterns in microbiomes may offer a more comprehensive view of complex microbial communities, constituting a complementary approach to estimates of alpha and beta diversity

a survey of proxies for two broad‐host‐range (BHR) plasmid groups, IncP‐1B and PromA, in Mussismilia hispida coral mucus and the surrounding seawater. These plasmids can efficiently transfer their genetic material to a wide range of hosts and have been widely used as proxies to evaluate the potential spread of genes in several environments

Another potential key aspect of coral microbiomes that has not received much attention is horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and the presence of specific patterns to support gene exchange

Plasmids, which are the main vectors for this genetic exchange, can act in the acquisition of genes or genetic pathways

We focused particularly on the BHR plasmid groups IncP‐1 and PromA, widely used as BHR plasmid proxies and indicated as the major providers of bacterial HGT in some soil environments

Our data also indicated that the holobiont selects (i.e., contains a higher abundance or even a specific persistence) the IncP‐1 and PromA groups of BHR plasmids, as these were significantly more abundant in coral mucus or absent in the seawater samples, respectively

considering the BHR that were screened, the IncP‐1 plasmid group was the most abundant plasmid group in the coral mucus bacteriome

group of plasmids can exchange a wide range of potentially advantageous genes, such as genes for antibiotic resistance and degradation of different carbon sources

[IncP‐1 and PromA, BHR groups of plasmids, are extremely important gene carriers in other systems, such as for soil bacterial communities] was detected only in coral mucus samples

we have found a large number of related OTUs (operational taxonomic units), mainly based on co‐occurrence among Proteobacteria and Firmicutes members
- something about these specific taxa (e.g., key functions), that is best, or exclusively, provided by these members, could not be replaced by other taxa or HGT
- Alternatively, or complementarily, interactions between taxa, or between the host and these taxa, maintain their presence or absence and the observed correlations
- merely a consequence of history, that is, successive vertical transmission of specific groups that leads to correlations
- co‐occurrence and taxonomic persistence could also suggest that these members might be actively involved in the persistence of other bacterial groups through symbiotic relationships

positive correlations were observed between the coral mucus and the abundance and/or the specific presence of the screened plasmids

The “enriched” presence of these MGEs within the holobiont could indicate that advantageous genes could be eventually exchanged between all members of the coral bacteriome

high prevalence of co‐occurrence between core bacterial groups and the specific plasmid‐pattern data could suggest separate roles in the coral bacterial assembly
- random consequence of the high prevalence of the dominant microbial diversity `->` randomly select those plasmids that can be established by the abundance of this dominant group
- this role could be associated with specific mechanisms, evolved to selectively permit the persistence of the dominant components of the bacteriome and associated plasmids
