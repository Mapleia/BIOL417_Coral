# Coral bacterial community structure responds to environmental change in a host-specific manner

{cite:t}`Ziegler_2019`

## Notes pulled from paper

> "The community of the coral host and its associated microbiome comprises a metaorganism and is referred to as the coral holobiont"

> "bacterial microbiome members fulfill a range of other functions including nitrogen fixation, sulfur cycling, and protection against pathogenic bacteria"

> "differences in the degree to which coral microbiomes vary over environmental gradients or experimental treatments"

> "Ctenactis echinata varied between different reef habitats to the degree that **abundance of coral host species** was associated with the **presence/absence of specific bacteria**"

> "microbial diversity was shown to increase with depth in several coral species, possibly allowing corals to access a broader range of food sources"

> "found seasonal fluctuations in coral-associated microbiomes"

> "tide-related shifts on much shorter time scales"

> "other corals maintain temporally stable microbiomes"

> "microbiomes change under adverse environmental conditions"

> "microbiomes of heat tolerant Acropora hyacinthus can be acquired by heat sensitive corals upon environmental transplantation over the course of 17 months"

> "Pocillopora verrucosa shows a globally conserved association with its main bacterial symbiont Endozoicomonas14 that remains unchanged even under conditions of bleaching and mortality"

> "P. verrucosa further was shown to maintain a stable Symbiodiniaceae community during a cross-transplantation experiment over depth25 and between seasons and reefs"

> "Porites lutea sampled under the same conditions had a highly flexible Symbiodiniaceae community"

> "coral genera ([coral species Acropora hemprichii and P. verrucosa]) were suspected to differ in the flexibility of their association with different microbial communities across environmental gradients"

> "coral microbiomes have previously been shown to recover from stress events, such as bleaching29 or disease30, we were interested to elucidate whether coral microbiomes can recover from chronic pollution, i.e. return to a state that resembles conspecific microbiomes at unaffected sites upon transplantation of coral fragments from affected to pristine sites"

> "potentially fast and flexible mechanism that may facilitate coral holobiont adaptation and broaden plasticity"

> "A. hemprichii microbiome is highly flexible and more variable"

> "P. verrucosa microbiome is fairly stable and overall less variable in response to changing environmental conditions"

> " increase in bacterial diversity in coral microbiomes often accompanies the holobiont stress response as a result of emerging opportunistic taxa that are otherwise absent or suppressed"

> "other bacterial families that were more abundant in A. hemprichii at the impacted sites (associated with coral disease) have also been isolated from healthy corals, which illustrates that shifts in microbial abundances do not exclusively or necessarily reflect a pathobiome, but rather an environmentally selected, putatively more beneficial microbiome"

> "environmentally explicit set of bacterial taxa that fill specific functional niches through changes in the microbiome of A. hemprichii is supported by the high number of specific taxa found under different impacts in our LEfSe and indicspecies analyses"

> "holobiont composition (or metaorganism structure for that matter) is not static, but rather dependent on age, development, sex, and environment, among other factors"

> "the microbiome of P. verrucosa was remarkably consistent between sites, with only small changes between impact levels in bacterial diversity and evenness"

> "Generally, there were no major abundance changes in bacterial taxa between impact levels in P. verrucosa, with the exception of the Simkaniaceae family"

> "these potentially represent differences in the underlying strategy employed by the two species to cope with environmental stress [...] (since they have) long generation times, evolutionary change is supposedly slow [...] (which means that) Strategies to cope with and survive rapid environmental change (is needed)"

    - "A. hemprichii [...] through their association with different bacterial taxa, whereby selection occurs for the most advantageous and beneficial microbiome in a particular environment"

> **"[they] argue that coral species differ in their ability to associate flexibly with different bacterial assemblages"**

- "'microbiome conformer' (showing microbial adaptation to the surrounding environment)" **vs**
    - A. hemprichii has a relatively slow growth rate
- "“microbiome regulator” (showing microbial regulation that maintains a constant microbiome)"
    - P. verrucosa shows a rather limited physiological plasticity and ecological niche space

> "recent study [...] proposed seven distinct bacterial phylotypes as universal coral core microbiome members"

- **"attempts to identify a universal coral core microbiome might result in only a small number of bacterial taxa, if different coral species are compared that display such high or low microbiome flexibility"**

> "coral fragments transplanted from impacted to control sites did not, after 21 months, continue to share similarities with fragments of the same colonies that remained at the impacted sites [...] stress-induced microbiome alterations may be reverted upon removal of chronic and long-term stressors"
