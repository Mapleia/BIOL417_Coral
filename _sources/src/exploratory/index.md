# Proposal ideas

## Idea from here
1. look for other (multiple) proteins that are related to
    A) increase in thermal tolerance
    B) increase in symbiont loss due to stress response
2. Look for sequences of those protein
3. Look for that sequence in coral species
4. narrow down the clades with that species

## Idea from here #2
1. look for other (multiple) proteins that are related to
    A) increase in thermal tolerance
    B) increase in symbiont loss due to stress response
2. Look for sequences of those protein
3. Look for patterns that indicate an increase in nonesense coding for regions within coral
4. Map that on a phylogenetic tree

## Idea from here #3

> "Adding bleaching and recovery symbiont assemblage data should further illuminate strategies used by HT and VT corals under thermal stress"

## Idea from here #4
change across time in coral mapped to heat events
- SNP
- microsatellite
