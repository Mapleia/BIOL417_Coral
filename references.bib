  abstract       = {The marine flora of Panama harbors a rich diversity of green, red and brown algae, and despite chronic understudy, it is reported as the second most diverse marine flora along the Pacific Central American coast, with 174 macroalgal species. Extensive new collections and molecular assisted identification (MAI) by an international team of researchers has revealed an even greater diversity for this country. Here, the intertidal and shallow subtidal marine flora of the remote Burica Peninsula is introduced. This area is characterized by an uplifted extensive intertidal flat composed of firm, sedimentary benthos known as mudrock, on which abundant algal communities thrive, even during extended periods of exposure. A collection of nearly 200 brown, green and red macroalgae specimens representing the first marine floristic inventory of this region was made in January 2011, and results of analyses of 45 foliose red algae specimens are presented. DNA sequence data for several loci (rbcL-3P; COI-5P; UPA) have been generated for molecular assisted identification and to guide morphological assessments. Twenty-six species were identified among the specimens including 21 new Pacific Panama records, as well as previously unrealized transisthmian distributions, and two new species, Neorubra parvolacertoides sp. nov. and Grateloupia irregularis sp. nov.},

  abstract     = {Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) are widely used to infer evolutionary relationships, enabling inferences of structure, function, and phylogeny. Standard practice is to construct one MSA by some preferred method and use it in further analysis; however, undetected MSA bias can be problematic. I describe Muscle5, a novel algorithm which constructs an ensemble of high-accuracy MSAs with diverse biases by perturbing a hidden Markov model and permuting its guide tree. Confidence in an inference is assessed as the fraction of the ensemble which supports it. Applied to phylogenetic tree estimation, I show that ensembles can confidently resolve topologies with low bootstrap according to standard methods, and conversely that some topologies with high bootstraps are incorrect. Applied to the phylogeny of RNA viruses, ensemble analysis shows that recently adopted taxonomic phyla are probably polyphyletic. Ensemble analysis can improve confidence assessment in any inference from an MSA.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

In this method, excess transitions, unequal nucleotide frequencies, and variation of substitution rate among different sites are all taken into account. Application of this method to human and chimpanzee data suggested that the transition/transversion ratio for the entire control region was approximately 15 and nearly the same for the two species. The 95\\% confidence interval of the age of the common ancestral mtDNA was estimated to be 80,000-480,000 years in humans and 0.57-2.72 Myr in common chimpanzees.}},
