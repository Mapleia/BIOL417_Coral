# Coral microbiome dynamics, functions and design in a changing world

## Notes pulled from paper

The most common coral bacteria belong to the phyla Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes and Tenericutes, whereas the archaea belong to the phyla Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a probe mix that universally targets bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes showed bacteria in the ectodermis of brooded larvae suggesting vertical transmission of bacteria

By contrast, FISH screening of several broadcast spawning coral species demonstrated a consistent absence of bacteria inside gametes, embryos and larvae. However, paraformaldehyde fixation, which is commonly used for FISH experiments, leads to the loss of the mucus layer 18,19 and thus any bacteria in the mucus

recent studies that used 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding found highly diverse bacterial communities associated with the early life stages of broadcast spawning corals

broadcast spawning corals, bacteria may be transmitted vertically to the gametes by incorporation into the mucus that surrounds egg–sperm bundles

the gametes may acquire bacteria immediately after release by horizontal transmission through water, which contains bacteria released by the parent colony

Coral larvae and early recruits generally have more diverse bacterial microbiomes than later life stages (Fig. 2b), indicating a winnowing process during coral maturation

bacterial community diversity decreases with increasing coral colony size [...] perhaps contributing to senescence

bacterial communities in the coral microhabitats differ in their gene composition, suggesting functional specialization

coral-associated bacteria reside in the surface mucus layer or possibly in the skeleton. The coral exudes considerable amounts of organic carbon, mostly in the dissolved form, which makes the mucus a nutrient-rich medium

Temperature changes influence the carbon composition of the mucus and thereby also the bacterial community structure

At lower taxonomic levels (for example, congeneric species) and across environmental gradients, environmental factors (such as water quality, light and temperature) have sometimes been found to be more important drivers of microbial communitycomposition than coral taxonomy

for mucus-associated bacteria, the correlation between host evolutionary divergence and microbiome dissimilarities breaks down with increasing divergence times

Corals apparently actively structure their microbiome by providing nutrients (promoting growth) and synthesizing and releasing antimicrobials (inhibiting growth) to the mucus;

A plethora of beneficial and detrimental roles for coral bacteria have been proposed, including the cycling and/or provisioning of nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen and sulfur, to coral or Symbiodiniaceae, protection of corals possibly through the production of antimicrobial compounds or competition for space and nutrients, and enhancement of larval settlement

Corals likely shape their microbiota for their benefit or the detriment of invading harmful microorganisms. Such activities require close interaction and communication between the host and bacteria.

It has recently been suggested that white band disease-causing bacteria use quorum sensing‐controlled pathways and that their virulence relies on such pathway

Whereas many corals harbour several hundred different bacterial operational taxonomic units, adult colonies of some Acropora spp. harbour as few as 30–40 operational taxonomic units, with only one or a few of these dominating the communities
